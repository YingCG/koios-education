      <h1>About Koios</h1>
      <p>
        Koios began as an idea that all students should have a right to pursue their education, as well as recognition that it can be difficult for students to access quality resources which can benefit their learning in a supportive, exciting and collaborative environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name Koios comes from Greek mythology origins - the Titan Koios is the Titan of Farsight, Resolve and Intelligence. The name Koios was adopted for our project with the hope that these values can be instilled within each of the students that this site reaches, and empowers them to take hold of their education and learn for their benefit and enjoyment.

        This website was developed with New Zealand students particularly in mind - to empower and encourage students throughout Aotearoa. With this in mind, during the curation of resources linked to on the site, New Zealand based references and resources have been used wherever possible.

        This site aims to provide students with a starting step in their learning - the resources here are a measly drop in the cup compared to what is avaiable to you through school or your own research. As you delve through lessons and videos remember why you want to learn, and how you can uphold and honor your future self through knowledge and hard work. The only limits imposed upon you are self inflicted.
